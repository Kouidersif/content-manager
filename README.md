# content-manager

The project was developed utilizing Django restframework and Tkinter to create Blog posts from Desktop Application using API. 
The project's objective is to enable the management, sharing, updating, and deletion of blog posts without granting access to the website. 
This feature could facilitate the hiring of freelancers instead of long-term content writers for businesses or enable individuals to publish their content with ease. 
Please NOTE!**
Currently, the app allows content sharing only, but it will receive additional functionalities like authentication, post editing, deletion, and greater flexibility in the future.
